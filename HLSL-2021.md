HLSL 2021 introduces new language features to facilitate shader writers. Many of them are very similar or identical to C++ counterparts. Where details are missing, C++ functionality can be assumed.

# Template functions and structs

Functions can be defined with generic type arguments provided those types support all the methods and operators used in the function. The effect is to define a function that is instantiated with type variants for each of the calls that use that type. The syntax involves specifying the templated types using the `template` keyword with parameters indicating the types within `<>` braces after it:

```c++
template <class Position, class Color>
Color BlendedSample(Position pos, Color col) {
  return g_tex.Sample(g_samp, pos)*col;
}
```

In similar fashion, structures can be created with generic types. Given HLSL's lack of constructors, instantiation type must be determined by explicit template parameters.

```hlsl
template<typename C, typename W>
struct Blender {
  C srcColor;
  C dstColor;
  W srcWeight;
  W dstWeight;
  C blend() { return srcColor*srcWeight + dstColor*dstWeight; }
};

float3 main(float4 col1 : COLOR0, float4 col2: COLOR2) : SV_Target {
  struct Blender<float3, float> B;
  B.srcColor = col1.rgb;
  B.dstColor = col2.rgb;
  B.srcWeight = col1.a;
  B.dstWeight = 1.0 - col1.a;
  return B.blend();
}
```

# Bitfields on struct elements

Bitfields increase the granularity of type sizes available to structure elements by allowing the inclusion of a numerical annotation after the field name:

```hlsl
struct BitfieldStruct {
  int x: 8;
  int : 8;
  int y : 16;
};
```

The effect of this is a struct that has three integer members, but only takes up 32 bits. Note that the size specified in the bitfield cannot exceed the size of the main type of the member. Anonymous elements can exclude the name for padding purposes:

```hlsl
struct FlagStruct {
  int flags: 24;
  int : 8;
};
```

# Operator overloading

To allow a broader use of templates and allow creation of types that might mimic the behavior of more familiar programming environments, operators can be defined for user-defined structs that allow those structs to be applied to existing operators just as native types can:

```hlsl
struct MyArray {
  float4 A[MAX_SIZE];
  
  void splat(float f) {
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_SIZE; i++)
      A[i] = f;
  };

  float4 operator[](int ix) {
    if (ix >= MAX_SIZE)
      return 0.0;
    return A[ix];
  };

  MyArray operator+(MyArray RHS) {
    MyArray OutArray;
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_SIZE; i++)
      OutArray.A[i] = A[i] + RHS.A[i];
    return OutArray;
  };

  void operator=(MyArray RHS) {
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_SIZE; i++)
      A[i] = A[i] + RHS.A[i];
  };
};


float4 main(float4 col1: COLOR0, float4 col2: COLOR2, int ix : I) : SV_Target {
  MyArray A, B;
  A.splat(col1);
  B.splat(col2);
  A = A + B;
  return A[ix];
}
```


# C++ style function overloading

HLSL2021 makes a backward incompatible change to implicit casting that results in function overloading that hews closer to C++ behavior.

Previously, a user defined struct that contained members of the same type and order as another struct would silently be cast into that other struct where relevant. This included when a struct was passed into a function. As a result, if you wanted to have two structs with identical layouts and a different function overload for each, the compiler considered the two overloaded functions to be ambiguous and would produce an error.

With HLSL2021, such implicit casts are disallowed and will produce an error. As a result, overloads that take structs with the same layout will be considered distinct. If the previously implicit casting behavior is desired, the code can easily be updated with an explicit cast that will work just fine.
