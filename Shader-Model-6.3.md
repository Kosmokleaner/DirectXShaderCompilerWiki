Shader model 6.3 adds support for DirectX12 Raytracing (DXR). This includes new intrinsics for casting rays into acceleration data structures, and processing the results. See the DX12 raytracing documentation. It also includes official HLSL compiled DXIL libraries and linking of shaders from these libraries, which has applications beyond raytracing.

An overview of the product is [here].
