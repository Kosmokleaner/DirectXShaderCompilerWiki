The plan for this project was originally announced last March at GDC 2016.
The presentation video is [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcDDvoauaz0&t=351s)
A PDF of the [slides](http://1drv.ms/1T8iew9) is also available on that page.

Here is a summary of the key points:

## Backlog of candidate language features
* Enums
* Bit-fields
* Language Standard Annotations
* References
* Unions
* Function Templates
* Visbility: 'public, private, protected, friend'
* Generic resource addressing

## Stretch language features
* 'constexpr'
* Assertions
* Function pointers (limited)
* Lambdas (limited)
* Virtuals
* Constructors, destructors, etc.
* Extern functions (linking)

## Out-of-scope language features
* Exceptions
* A stack
* Recursion
* STL Containers
* C99/stdlib compatibility
* Garbage collection

## Candidate hardware features
* Explicit float16/"half" type
* Blender intrinsics
* More atomic operations
* Stereo system values (SV_XXXX)
* Programmable blending (aka RT Read)
* Input of arbitrary structures
* More control over IEEE behavior
* Future GPU features
