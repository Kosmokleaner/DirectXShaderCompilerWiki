## Features and Goals

The starting point of the project is a fork of the [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) and [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/) projects, modified to accept HLSL and emit a validated container that can be consumed by GPU drivers.

At the moment, the DirectX HLSL Compiler provides the following components:

- dxc.exe, a command-line tool that can compile shader model 6 HLSL programs

- dxcompiler.dll, a DLL providing a componentized compiler, assembler, disassembler, and validator

- various other tools based on the above components

The DirectX Shader Compiler is currently in preview stage but is expected to be finalized in the next few months. The Microsoft Windows SDK releases will include a supported version of the compiler and validator.

The goal of the project is to allow the broader community of shader developers to contribute to the language and representation of shader programs, maintaining the principles of compatibility and supportability for the platform. It's currently in active development across two axes: language evolution (with no impact to DXIL representation), and surfacing hardware capabilities (with impact to DXIL, and thus requiring coordination with GPU implementations).
